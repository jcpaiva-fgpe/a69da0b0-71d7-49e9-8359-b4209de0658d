The sequence of these bases forms genes, which in turn create proteins. Sometimes, it's needed to find the complement of a DNA strand, which means to find and return the base pairs for each nucleotide. The base pairs are A-T and C-G. For example, if the original strand is 'ACTG', its complement is 'TGAC'. You need to implement a function that will receive a DNA strand and return its complement.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Create a function that receives a DNA strand (a string containing only the letters A, C, T or G) and returns its complement (a string containing the complementary letters for each nucleotide).</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The input will be a string containing only the letters A, C, T or G.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The output should be the complement of the input string, where the pairs of nucleotide bases are A-T and C-G.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"ACTG"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"TGAC"</pre></body></html>
