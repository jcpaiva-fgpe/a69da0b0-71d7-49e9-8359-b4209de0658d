It is important to make sure that the brackets are balanced, meaning that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. This exercise will help you practice checking if a string of brackets is balanced.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Write a function that takes a string of brackets as input and returns True if the brackets are balanced, and False if they are not.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The input to the function will be a string of brackets, containing only the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}'.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The function will return a boolean value: True if the input string of brackets is balanced, and False if it is not balanced.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"()[]{}"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>true</pre></body></html>
