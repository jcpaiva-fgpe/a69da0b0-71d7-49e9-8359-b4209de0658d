ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome. Caesar cipher is a technique for encryption that can be easily decrypted by an unauthorized person. So, to create a cipher that could hide information, the ROT13 cipher was created. Now, it has become a common way of encrypting text on the internet.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Create a function that takes a string of text and returns the text ciphered with ROT13. Only letters will be ciphered, spaces and punctuation will remain unaltered.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>A string of text.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The ciphered string.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"hello world"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"uryyb jbeyq"</pre></body></html>
