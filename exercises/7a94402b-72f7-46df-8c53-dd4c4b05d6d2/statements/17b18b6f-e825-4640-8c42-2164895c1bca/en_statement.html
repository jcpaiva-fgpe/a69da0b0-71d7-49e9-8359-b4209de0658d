This operation is often used to simplify certain calculations, such as determining if a system of linear equations is solvable. Write a function that receives a matrix and returns its transpose, that is, a matrix where the rows and columns are swapped.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Create a function that receives a matrix and returns its transpose.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The function receives a matrix as a list of lists of integers.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The function should return the transpose of the matrix, that is, a matrix where the rows and columns are swapped.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]"</pre></body></html>
