This puzzle is counterintuitive because our intuition says that the probability should be very low even when the number of people is large. But the actual probability is quite high even for relatively small numbers of people.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Write a function that takes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 365) as input and returns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. The probability should be rounded to two decimal places.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 365) representing the number of people in the set.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The output is a float number rounded to two decimal places representing the probability that some pair of people in the set will have the same birthday.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"23"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"0.51"</pre></body></html>
