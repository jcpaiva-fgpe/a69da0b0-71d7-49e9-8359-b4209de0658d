This idea has been used to study the group formation and network theories. In this second edition, we want to create a function that takes a group of people and calculates the probability of two people having the same birthday.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Create a function that takes an integer n as number of people in a group and returns the probability that two or more people will share the same birthday. Assume that the probability of being born on any day is the same and ignore leap years. Round the result to two decimal places.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>An integer n representing the number of people in a group.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>A float representing the probability that two or more people in the group share the same birthday.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"5"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"0.03"</pre></body></html>
