This is a common operation in image processing and computer graphics.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Write a function that receives a 2D matrix and returns the same matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The function receives a 2D matrix as input, represented by a list of lists. Each inner list is a row and the values ​​represent the columns.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The function should return a 2D matrix as output, represented by a list of lists, that is the input matrix rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"[[7, 4, 1],[8, 5, 2],[9, 6, 3]]"</pre></body></html>
