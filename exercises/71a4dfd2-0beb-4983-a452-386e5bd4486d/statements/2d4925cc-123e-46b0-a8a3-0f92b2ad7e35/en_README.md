The Postman Paul
================

![Illustration](image.jpg)

Postman Paulo and his black and white cat go every morning to deliver the mail in their red van. Everyone in town waves as he passes.

Paulo's van has a limited capacity and sometimes the mail bags exceed the load limit. When that happens, Paulo wants to fill his van as much as possible, taking as much weight as possible. However, Paulo cannot remove letters and parcels from one bag to another and he can only decide whether or not a certain bag will be transported in the van.

Imagine for example that Paulo had 4 bags weighing 4Kg, 5Kg, 7Kg and 8Kg in the mail. If the carrying capacity is 10Kg of mail, what is the maximum weight of mail that Paulo can carry on a trip? In this case, the best you can do is carry 9Kg, which corresponds to transporting the two bags of 4Kg and 5Kg. And in the general case? You have to help Paulo!


Task
------

Given a set of mailbags and their respective weights, as well as the load limit of Paulo's red van, your task is to calculate the maximum weight that Paulo can carry in the van, knowing that a mailbag cannot be divided (either transported in the van or left at the post office).


Input
-----

In the first line of the _input_ there is a single line containing two integers **S** and **C**, separated by a space, where **S** indicates the number of mailbags and **C** indicates the maximum load capacity of the van (_1 ≤ S ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ C ≤ 10000_).

Exactly **S** lines follow, each containing an integer containing the **Pi** weight of a mail bag (_1 ≤ Pi ≤ 500_). The bags can come in any order and there can be multiple bags of the same weight.


Output
------

The _output_ consists of a single line, indicating the maximum weight that the van can carry, that is, the highest sum of weights of a set of mail bags that is less than or equal to the van's load capacity.
