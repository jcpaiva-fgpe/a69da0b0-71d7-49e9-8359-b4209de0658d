It is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, which are the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of (a + b)^n, where n is a positive integer. In this triangle, the first and last numbers in each row are always 1, and each of the other numbers in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the first n rows of Pascal's triangle. Each row should be returned as a list of integers.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>The input will be a single positive integer n (1 <= n <= 30), representing the number of rows to return.</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>The function should return a list of lists of integers. Each inner list represents a row of Pascal's triangle, starting from the first row (which is always [1]).</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"5"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"[[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]"</pre></body></html>
