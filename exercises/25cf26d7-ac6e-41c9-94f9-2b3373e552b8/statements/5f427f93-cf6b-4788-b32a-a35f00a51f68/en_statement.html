The game is played with a group of people taking turns to say numbers starting from 1. However, when the number is a multiple of 3, the player should say 'Fizz' instead. If the number is a multiple of 5, the player should say 'Buzz'. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the player should say 'Fizz Buzz'. This exercise involves creating a function that checks if a given number adheres to the rules of Fizz Buzz.</p><p></p><h2>Task</h2><p></p><p>Create a function that takes a number as input and returns 'Fizz' if the number is a multiple of 3, 'Buzz' if the number is a multiple of 5, 'Fizz Buzz' if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, or the number itself if none of the conditions are met.</p><p></p><h2>Input</h2><p></p><p>An integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^9</p><p></p><h2>Output</h2><p></p><p>Output a string representing 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'Fizz Buzz' or the input number as a string.</p><p></p><h2>Example</h2><h3>Input</h3><pre>"15"</pre><h3>Output</h3><pre>"'Fizz Buzz'"</pre></body></html>
